# Personality-dection_RoBERT_Bi-LSTM

This repository contains code and data for the research project on Personality Trait Prediction using two different models: RoBERTa and Bi-LSTM. The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of these models in predicting personality traits and capturing correlations among personality traits based on user-generated text.
